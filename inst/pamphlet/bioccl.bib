abstract = {To the Editor:
RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is used to measure gene expression levels across the transcriptome for a huge variety of samples. For example, RNA-seq has been applied to study gene expression in individuals with rare diseases, in hard-to-obtain tissues or for rare forms of cancer. Recently, enormous RNA-seq datasets have{\ldots}},

@article{Quake2017,
abstract = {We have created a compendium of single cell transcriptome data from the model organism Mus musculus comprising nearly 100,000 cells from 20 organs and tissues. These data reveal many new aspects of cell biology, including gene expression in poorly characterized cell populations and the characterization of new populations of cells in many tissues. Furthermore, they allow for direct and controlled comparison of gene expression in cell types shared between tissues, such as immune cells from distinct anatomical locations. Two distinct technical approaches were used for most organs: one approach, microfluidic droplet-based 3-end counting, enabled the survey of thousands of cells at relatively low coverage, while the other, FACS-based full length transcript analysis, enabled characterization of cell types with high sensitivity and coverage. The cumulative resource provides the foundation for a comprehensive resource of transcriptomic cell biology.},

@article{Darmanis2017,
abstract = {Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain cancer in adults and is notoriously difficult to treat because of its diffuse nature. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on 3,589 cells in a cohort of four patients. We obtained cells from the tumor core as well as surrounding peripheral tissue. Our analysis revealed cellular variation in the tumor's genome and transcriptome. We were also able to identify infiltrating neoplastic cells in regions peripheral to the core lesions. Despite the existence of significant heterogeneity among neoplastic cells, we found that infiltrating GBM cells share a consistent gene signature between patients, suggesting a common mechanism of infiltration. Additionally, in investigating the immunological response to the tumors, we found transcriptionally distinct myeloid cell populations residing in the tumor core and the surrounding peritumoral space. Our data provide a detailed dissection of GBM cell types, revealing an abundance of information about tumor formation and migration. Darmanis et al. perform single-cell transcriptomic analyses of neoplastic and stromal cells within and proximal to primary glioblastomas. The authors describe a population of neoplastic-infiltrating glioblastoma cells as well as a putative role of tumor-infiltrating immune cells in supporting tumor growth.},

@article{Ramos2017,
abstract = {Multi-omics experiments are increasingly commonplace in biomedical research, and add layers of complexity to experimental design, data integration, and analysis. R and Bioconductor provide a generic framework for statistical analysis and visualization, as well as specialized data classes for a variety of high-throughput data types, but methods are lacking for integrative analysis of multi-omics experiments. The MultiAssayExperiment software package, implemented in R and leveraging Bioconductor software and design principles, provides for the coordinated representation of, storage of, and operation on multiple diverse genomics data. We provide all of the multiple 'omics data for each cancer tissue in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) as ready-to-analyze MultiAssayExperiment objects, and demonstrate in these and other datasets how the software simplifies data representation, statistical analysis, and visualization. The MultiAssayExperiment Bioconductor package reduces major obstacles to efficient, scalable and reproducible statistical analysis of multi-omics data and enhances data science applications of multiple omics datasets.},
